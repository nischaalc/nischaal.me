My portfolio website
=======================

My personal portfolio website - developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and a few JavaScript Libraries.
My first official foray into Web Development so feel free to let me know if you encounter any issues! 

*I would appreciate if you didn't copy this design.*

**Default branch is `gh-pages` - `master` will not be updated any longer.
