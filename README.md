Currently in the works!
=======================

My personal portfolio website - development in progress using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and a few JS Libraries.
Editor of choice - [Brackets.io](http://brackets.io)

Notes
-----

* The site isn't fully responsive as yet - resizing the browser window will cause all sorts of glitches. I'm working on 
this.
* There are no scripts implemented - I haven't really had the need to include them yet.
* Some of the images and text currently visible are just placeholders.
