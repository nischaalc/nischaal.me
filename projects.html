	<p class = "modal-summary">Shopaholic is an app that wants to change the way you shop.
	No longer will you have to worry about finding something that you need - 
	Shopaholic will tell you which stores have it, along with a whole ton of details about the item and how to get to the stores that are selling it!
	Add items to your Cart and once you feel like you've added enough, tell Shopaholic to do its' magic and it'll calculate which
	store is selling most, if not all, of the items that you want - for the lowest total price.</br>

	<p class = "modal-title">Paata!</p>
	<p class = "tag">Color everything!</p>
	<p class="lead">Built for the web! Please contact me if you encounter any issues with the site!</p>
	<p class = "modal-summary">As someone interested in design, I know that colors play a
	major role in the UX and picking the right ones can make or break your interface! Because of this
	I decided to build a color picker <a href = "colorpicker.com">(this sort of thing)</a> that
	would stand out from the rest. Paata (<em>Sinhalese for "color"</em>) is the result of this experiment.
	The minimal interface presents three sliders that allow you to change RGB 
	values and your changes are reflected in the change to the background. Paata gives you your color values in RGB,
	hex and generates a color that complements your color!</br>
