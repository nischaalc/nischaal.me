	Hailing from Sri Lanka, I have attended two of the leading schools in the country, starting at 
	<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Thomas'_Preparatory_School">St. Thomas' Preparatory School</a>
	and finishing my education at <a href = "http://britishschool.lk/home/">The British School in Colombo</a>. Somewhere
	in between these two waypoints, I developed a love for computers which has guided the choices I've made
	in life. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am currently studying at <a href = "www.drexel.edu">Drexel University</a> in <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia">
	Philadelphia</a>, where I aim to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in <a href = "http://www.drexel.edu/cs/">
	Computer Science</a> by 2018. Being a Dragon (that's what we Drexel students call ourselves) has given me the opportunity to 
	work with others on several projects, most of which can be found at	my 
	<a href = "https://github.com/nischaalc">GitHub</a>. 
	<p>
	My main interest in becoming a computer scientist was to learn more about
	<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target = "_blank">
	Artificial Intelligence</a> but I found that I also enjoy mobile development, Web development and UX
	design. This is probably my one gripe about CS - being such a vast field, how are we meant to find
	a single thing that we love doing more than anything else?!
	</p>
	<p>
	Anyway, that's pretty much everything about me that can't be found on my personal pages (links below).
	Feel free to contact me, I don't bite!
