	Hailing from <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" target = "_blank" >Sri Lanka</a>, I have attended two of the leading schools in the country, starting at 
	<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Thomas'_Preparatory_School" target = "_blank" >St. Thomas' Preparatory School</a>
	and finishing my education at <a href = "http://britishschool.lk/home/" target = "_blank" >The British School in Colombo</a>. Somewhere
	in between these two waypoints, I developed a love for computers which has guided the choices I've made
	in life. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am currently studying at <a href = "http://www.drexel.edu" target = "_blank" >Drexel University</a> in 
	<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" target = "_blank" >Philadelphia</a>,
	where I aim to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in <a href = "http://www.drexel.edu/cs/" target = "_blank" >
	Computer Science</a> by 2018. Being a Dragon (that's what we Drexel students call ourselves) has given me the opportunity to 
	work with others on several projects, most of which can be found at	my 
	<a href = "https://github.com/nischaalc" target = "_blank" >GitHub</a>. 
	<p>
	My main interest in becoming a computer scientist was to learn more about
	<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target = "_blank">
	Artificial Intelligence</a> but, along the way, I found that I also enjoy <a href = "https://github.com/nischaalc/Shopaholic" target = "_blank" >mobile 
	development</a>, <a href = "http://nischaalc.github.io/nischaal.me/index.html" target = "_blank">Web development</a> and <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design" target = "_blank" >UX	design</a> (so far!). 
	This is probably my one gripe about CS - being such a vast field, how are we meant to find a 
	single thing that we love doing more than anything else?!
	</p>
	<p>
	Anyway, that's pretty much everything about me that can't be found on my personal pages (links below).
	Feel free to contact me, I don't bite!
